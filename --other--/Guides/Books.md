# My Process for Books

## Downloading

1. Go to Readarr and add the Author
2. Look through the list of books added and remove any from the list that are not relevant
3. Scan and find books
4. For any books that can not be found (or not in the correct format) Source them directly and do a manual import
5. All books should download to the `/media/Downloads/Books` dir

## Fixing EPUBs

1. After the books are downloaded, import them into Calibre
2. Fix all the meta data

## Viewing the EPUBs

2. Read directly in the web or send to Kindle
